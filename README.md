MY THOUGHTS ABOUT GOMYCODE AND THE NEXT STEPS

🚀 My Bootcamp Journey and What Lies Ahead
As I reach the end of this incredible Bootcamp journey, I take a moment to reflect on the growth, challenges, and transformations that have shaped me over the past weeks. 
This has not just been a course—it's been a turning point in my career, mindset, and life.

🙏 Gratitude for the Bootcamp Experience
First, I want to deeply appreciate the rigor and structure of the Bootcamp. 
It was not easy—juggling between learning new technical skills, managing work responsibilities, and being present as a parent was no small feat. But every late night, every bug fixed, and every concept grasped was worth it.

This Bootcamp tested my discipline and resilience, and I’m proud to say I came out stronger. 
The consistency and support from the Gomycode team created a space where what once seemed impossible now feels within reach.

💼 Why I Joined — And What I Gained
Coming from a background in business analysis, I joined the Bootcamp with a clear goal: 
to write better, clearer, and more technically sound user stories—stories that are not only aligned with business objectives but also easy for developers to estimate, configure, and implement.

This goal has been more than achieved.

Today, I can confidently:

Break down complex requirements into precise, manageable development tasks.

Estimate efforts and align timelines based on technical realities.

Collaborate more effectively with developers, understanding the depth and breadth of their work.

But more than that, I’m not stopping at documentation—I’m now ready to start coding those stories myself.

🛠️ Embracing Development
Armed with the skills I've gained—from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, to databases like MongoDB—I’m excited to take the next big step. 
I will begin implementing the very systems I once only analyzed. I’ve already started preparing tasks for implementation, and I’m actively building web applications to sharpen my frontend and backend development skills.

This ability to bridge business and development is already transforming how I work—and it's only the beginning.

🌱 The Learning Never Stops
One of the greatest lessons this Bootcamp has taught me is how to learn. In tech, things evolve fast, and the real skill is the ability to keep growing.
I’ve become a better problem solver, thinker, and learner.

I look forward to:

Continuously polishing my coding skills

Learning more advanced tools and frameworks

Contributing to real-world projects

And ultimately, becoming a great software engineer

🙌 Thank You, Gomycode & Andre Leon Kaeulana
To the entire Gomycode team—thank you for making this opportunity possible. 
You gave us more than technical skills—you gave us confidence, purpose, and a new identity. What once felt like a distant dream is now my reality.

A special note of gratitude to my instructor, Andre Leon Kaeulana—your support, guidance, and encouragement throughout this journey made all the difference. Your teaching style, patience, and clarity helped me overcome doubts and truly believe in my ability to code and grow in this field. Thank you for being such a key part of my transformation.

I am no longer just a Business Analyst—I’m a future software engineer, empowered and equipped.

I feel transformed.
I feel accomplished.
I feel awesome.

Many, many thanks 🙏
